				the following items. Answer this as fast as you can. Good luck and God Bless!

				<table><tr><th><p id="selection">FAITH AND MUSIC<br>
The Filipino is sustained by his faith and his music. This was the observation made many 
years ago by a noted Jesuit. This I saw, felt and believed when I took a summer vacation 
in my father's hometown. For example, Tata Kandong would work like a horse the whole 
day as he shuttles endlessly between his vegetable farm and his modest piggery. In the 
evenings he would play his banduria and tell lots of stories between his pieces. Then he 
would sound solemn and pious in saying, "God will send us rain for our rice field soon."
My father's youngest sister, Tita Cora, was a fine example of wife and mother would put 
her young to sleep with her sweet lullabies. Going back to her work as a seamstress, she 
would hum lovely kundiman. On one occasion, she paused and with a glint on her eyes, 
she hoped her two children would be successful professionals. My cousin, Josuel, just 
graduated from high school. He had to walk five kilometers every day to school as there 
were no available means of transportation. Some evenings we would share some praise 
songs. "I hope". He wistfully said once, "I can be a lawyer, so I can help the victims of 
exploitation in our town." Tata Kandong, Tita Cora and Josuel typify the strong and 
resolute Filipinos. While life is difficult, hope springs eternal from their hearts, by the 
power of their faith and music.</p></th></tr></table>

					OBEDIENCE<br>
What is obedience? It consists putting our own will to the will of another. It is a habit of 
following a law or command. It is a virtue necessary for everyone, especially children and 
young people. It is the basis of order. Without obedience life will be a great disorder. It 
has been said that he who rightly obeys will live right; he will live sweetly, free from cares 
and troubles. He cannot grow or progress if he does not learn to obey. He is not safe and 
happy if does not obey orders. But obedience appears unattractive to the eyes of young 
people. They want to enjoy their liberty. Admittedly, this is the trend now or what seems 
to be. Therefore, it is most necessary that they be wisely advised. Always be obedient. 
You will find it very difficult at times, when pride or bad temper wants to dominate. you 
should learn to bow, that is to obey while you are still young and you will have done a 
great deal to promote the happiness of your future life. Obedience is something not to be 
ashamed of. You cannot live without it. Even the president of the country is not exempted 
from obedience. He/She has to obey the laws. He/She have helped to make, so obey 
God, your parents, teachers, superiors, people in authority, laws of government, and 
customs of society. Obedience must be our law. And what a happy and world this be if 
everyone is obedient.

					CHOPSTICK <br>
Chopstick were invented in China over thousand years ago, probably evolving from twigs 
used to spear food from a cooking pot. Knives took over this function in the West, but 
Confucius, who considered knives instruments of aggression, encouraged the use of 
chopsticks as part of his teaching of nonviolence. The name in Chinese is kuaizi, which 
means "quick little fellows: came from the pidgin English for kuai. Chopsticks spread 
throughout the orient, those belonging to the rich made of gold, silver, ivory, or jade. Most 
however, were-and are made of bamboo, which was plentiful and cheap, with no taste or 
smell that could affect the food. The Japanese made them from a variety of woods and 
lacquered them for durability. It was not until the late 19th century that the disposable 
bamboo variety became popular. Traditionally, Chinese and Japanese chopsticks differ 
in length and shape. The Chinese are ten inches long, square, and blunt at the tip. While 
the Japanese are rounded, come to a point, and are a couple of inches shorter. They are 
efficient enough to pick up a single grain of rice, but the accepted way to eat rice is to use 
the chopsticks almost like scoop, moving the grains from a small bowl held close to the 
mouth. Chopstick etiquette says you should not gesture with them as you talk, nor should 
you use them to pass food. And you're inviting misfortune if you drop them or place them 
crossed on your plate, unless you do it in a restaurant to show the waiter you're finished 
and ready for the check.

					VERB <br>
The verb is the business end of a sentence, the sentence’s reason for being. That’s where 
the action is. Without a verb, even if it’s only suggested, there’s nothing going on, just a Louie Johnson Bastasa
lot of nouns standing around with their hands in their pockets. A verb is easy to spot. Just 
look for the moving target, the center of activity, the part that tells you what’s going on. 
No wonder the verb is the most interesting word in a sentence. It is also the most 
complicated. Because the verb expresses action, it has something that other words lack time. It has to tell you whether something happened in the past, the present, the future or 
some combination of times: sneeze, sneezed, will sneeze, would have sneezed and so 
on. The verb has another aspect too. It varies according to who or what is performing the 
action: sneeze, he sneezes, they sneeze, and so on. There are plenty of reasons a verb 
can go astray. The most common is that it doesn’t match the subject: one is singular and 
the other is plural. For example, Pocholo and I was sneezing. The next most common 
reason is that the verb’s timing-its tense-is off. (Yesterday she sneezes.). This makes 
verb sound daunting, but they’re really not so bad. Taken one a t a time (which is how 
you encounter them, after all) problems with verb can be made to disappear

will have to take much more aggressive action against global warming. Pasta is made 
from wheat, and a large growing body of scientific studies and real-world observations 
suggest what wheat will be hit especially hard as temperatures rise and storms and 
drought intensify in the years ahead. Three grains-wheat, con and rice account for most 
of the food that humans consume. All these are already suffering from climate change, 
but wheat stands to fare the worst in the years ahead, for it is the grain most vulnerable 
to high temperatures. Those spells trouble not only for pasta but also for bread, the most

of today needs more of this power to translate reflection into action. I believe that we are

					HAPPINESS <br>
We strive for happiness, generally in self-centered ways. We expect others to favor us 
with their attention, for example, or we wait for invitations or gifts. We have probably tried 
to buy happiness with purchase of a new dress or shoes. Fleeting moments of happiness 
are gained, that's all. And soon we are discontented once again. But things may have 
changed for some of us. We are learning, maybe slowly, how to find more permanent 
happiness. And we know that happiness that comes from "getting" is elusive. Giving to 
others, sharing our stories with others, listening to theirs, is the key to finding the 
happiness for which we have searched so long. We must get outside of ourselves and 
focus on other's joys or sorrows. Only then do we get a clear perspective on who we are 
and the necessary role we play in the lives of others who need our attention and who 
have a message we also need to hear.

					KNEE <br>
The knee is the largest part of the body and is one of the most complicated. At the same 
time, the knee joint swings like a hinge and lifts like a lever. It flexes to absorb shock as 
we walk or run and to protect our other bones from jarring or grinding. Without the knee, 
humans could not stand up, walk climb or kick. Every day, every knee receives a routine 
workout. But the runners and other athletes in high-impact sports, the knee receives a 
serious pounding. Overuse can lead to serious injury. In fact, one out of every four sports 
injuries involve the knee. "Runner's knee" is the most common injury from overuse. 
People with runner's knee complain of dull, aching, pain under or around their kneecaps. 
The pain seems to worsen when they descend stairs or run-down hills. To protect their 
knees, athletes should look at their shoes. Exercise shoes must fit and wear well in order 
to minimize risk to the knee. If an athlete wishes to increases the time or intensity of his 
workout, this must be done slowly in a step-by-step- fashion. Athlete should work to 
strengthen their quadriceps, the large muscles group on the front of the thigh. In many 
runners the quadriceps are not as strong as the hamstrings. This uneven strengthen the quadriceps muscles. Many serious runners switch off between cycling and running as 
they train.

					POVERTY<br>
Studies have consistently pointed to at least three major immediate factors that push 
children to stay or live on the streets. These are the poverty of the family, family 
relationship factors (physical or sexual abuse) and peer influence. Poverty and peer 
influence when compounded with problems and stresses in the family life such as family 
break-up, child abuses and neglect. Domestic violence by step-parents, underemployed 
parents, etc. Altogether create under pressure on the child to leave home and find solace. 
Protection and support from the peers on the street, eventually becoming susceptible to 
their influence and lifestyle. In Metro Manila, population growth, urbanization, and 
migration have increased through the years. Children are often forced to try 
circumstances to help their family eke out of living or tend for themselves on the streets.

finding better job opportunities in the city. But whose lack of education rendered them illequipped to struggle for survival in the urban jungle and are thus curtained to a life of

Birds don't seem to suffer from jet lag. But then again, they don't suffer from airport delays. 
Crowded sealing, inedible airline food or lost luggage either. Human jet lag seems to be 
bound inevitably to passing rapidly through different time zones. Birds usually migrate 
from north to south often not encountering any time change in their journey. A veterinarian 
speculates that if you put a bird on a place going east to west, it might feel jet lag. But 
birds, unlike humans, don't try to fly that way and cross several time zone in one day.
Some migrations can take up to several weeks. Birds don't stretch their physical limits,
